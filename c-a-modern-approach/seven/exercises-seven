Exercises

1.	(a) 63
	(b) 119
	(c) 12 + 176 + 2560 =  2748

2.	(a) Legal, floating point
	(b) Legal, integer
	(c) Illegal; Octal would be integer, but 9 is not allowed in octal
	(d) Illegal; _ is not a valid suffix for either int nor float
	(e) Legal: -2 = 3.978 * (10 ^ -2)

3.	(a) Legal
	(b) Illegal
	(c) Legal
	(d) Legal

4.	(a) Legal
	(b) Legal
	(c) Legal
	(d) illegal (its not even in the right syntax!)

5.	(b) Illegal. 0b, while a legitimate modern way to refer to binary that works in GCC and modern compilers,
			is not actually part of the C standard (at least, I don't think! the other answers are all 100% valid)

6.	(a) char
	(b) short
	(c) short
	(d) long

7. 	(a) \142    \b 98
	(b) \156	\n 110
	(c) \162	\r 114
	(d) \164	\t 116

8.	(a) \x62
	(b) \x6E
	(c) \x72
	(d) \x74 
 
9.	int. 'a' is converted via Integral Promotion to an integer.

10.	unsigned int. (int) j * k = unsigned int. When a signed and unsigned int are compared, the int is converted to unsigned

11. double

12. double. (i + f) becomes a float, after which the right operand becomes the same type as the left operand before assignment

13.	(a) -3 int
	(b) 7 long
	(c) 6.5 float
	(d) 3.75 double
	(e) -1	double
	(f) 6 int

14. Usually, but float has a larger memory size than int, so if the float number is too big, it may not fit!

15.
